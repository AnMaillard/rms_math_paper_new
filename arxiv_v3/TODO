I add a (*) to the line rather than (-) if the change is done.

For revision (17.09.25):
  * After all changes, check formatting (page breaks etc)
  * Update arXiv
  * Check that I don't say anything wrong on second moment method failing vs annealed != quenched (cite paper of Subag? maybe not necessary)
  * Update phase diagram plots with 
    (1) what I used for the talks (in particular showing E[Z] >> 1 in orange region)
    (2) Adding the region kappa > 2, with a brutal cut-off and a SAT (trivial) label
  * The second moment computation should apparently suggest whether freezing should hold (according to R1). I should look where I can find this, and add a comment on that.
    * Look at Aubin&al for this intuition!
    * Perkins & xu gives a formal proof, the idea is to have contiguity. But here I am not sure how would contiguity work: conditioning W_i on satisying the constraint is hard...
    * Still I should look at this in greater detail!
    * I have now clarified it (18.09.25, Flexcil): I can add this as another open problem, a short discussion on freezing and contiguity.
    * I should re-organize Section 1.3, by introducing some "Open problems" that can be listed, and that I mention again at the end. This is nice, for future work. 
    And I can discuss more the freezing of the solutions, and the contiguity issue.
  * Add a short subsection at the end listing the open problems: 
        freezing, RSB, limiting ESD for correlated GOEs, checking the technical condition for failure of second moment, etc...
  * Comments from R2:
    * Perhaps introducing the Boolean entropy function H(x) = -xlog(x) - (1-x)log(1-x) would make Equation (5) a little more transparent? (It appears anyway later on p21.)
    * On p12, it is worth mentioning that the algorithm analyzed by Kunisky and Zhang (2023) is actually originally due to Zouzias, 
      and is just given a more precise analysis in the KZ23 citation in the average case setting.
    * The discussion at the top of p13 seems a little confusing - the author makes it sound like in the proof it is important to have the more general large deviations principles 
     for beta-ensembles versus just for the empirical spectral distribution of a GOE matrix. 
     Why would that be, when the probability in question here is just a probability about the latter for specifically a GOE matrix? 
     Is the author trying to suggest that Proposition 2.3 could be used to derive similar limiting laws for the spectrum conditional on a small norm for other such ensembles aside from the GOE?
    * Very minor point: on p14, the formatting of Theorem 2.5 is a little strange with an extra line break, and for some reason "Edward B Saff" is always expanded in full unlike the abbreviations to just the last names of all other citations.
    * The "Fourier transform" in Lemma 2.7 is probably more commonly known as the "characteristic function" in probability literature.
    * Around Equation (36) on p21, it would be helpful to indicate that the calculations to follow are in the same spirit as extracting cumulants from derivatives of the cumulant generating function, 
    expectations of observables under a Gibbs measure from derivatives of the log-partition function, and so forth. This would also clarify the discussion of Hypothesis 4.1 later.
    * Around Lemma 3.5, maybe as a separate proposition or observation the author could observe that the sub-Gaussian norm directly controls the variance, as is used in Lemma 3.5 (as far as I understand)?

Old TODO: 
- After, go back to my ''Remarks for resubmission'' notes for good references on limits of matrix models, perturbative expansions of HCIZ integrals, etc...
- Prove the technical assumption?
